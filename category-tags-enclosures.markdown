The Texas Supreme Court has dramatically rolled back the scope of the public 
trust doctrine as it applies to Texas beaches in a 5-3 ruling by the all-Republican 
court. This means that the public’s right to enjoy shorefront on the Gulf of 
Mexico will be sharply curtailed in the years ahead -- a major victory for 
private property fundamentalists.  Judicial activism, anyone?

The [court’s decision][1] focused on the public's access rights to beaches 
when hurricanes or storms have eroded a public strip of beach.  Should the 
public be prohibited from using the "new beach" that might now be situated 
on privately owned land?  Or should there be a “rolling easement” that recognizes 
public access no matter how natural forces remake the actual shoreline? 

For decades, the Texas state public trust doctrine gave a rolling easement 
that assured public access to beaches.  That access right did not inhere in 
a particular strip of land, but in a general right of access.  Now, the court![][2] 
ruled, reversing decades of established law, if a storm washes away the public 
beach, “the land encumbered by the easement is lost to the public trust, along 
with the easement attached to that land.”  As reported by the [Texas Observer][3], 
“the court dismissed the 180-year-old custom of public enjoyment of Texas beaches 
as ‘unsupported by historic jurisprudence’ and ‘a limitation on private property 
rights’.”

State attorney general Greg Abbott noted:  “With the stroke of a pen, a divided 
court has effectively eliminated the public's rights on the dry beach….The 
majority could only cite—nothing.  Not a single case, rule, precedent, principle, 
empirical study, scientific review, or anything else.”  Even the Galveston 
Chamber of Commerce joined the attorney general in seeking to uphold the historic 
understanding of the public trust doctrine.

It was a pleasure to see Arnold Relman and Marcia Angell receive such well-deserved 
visibility in [yesterday’s _New York Times_ ][4]for their campaigns against 
the “commercial exploitation of medicine.” Drs. Relman and Angell are both 
former editors of _The New England Journal of Medicine_, together and separately, 
from 1977 to 2000.  They are also husband and wife since 2009.  He’s 88 and 
retired, and she’s 72 and still teaches at Harvard Medical School. 

Relman and Angell built the _NEJM_ into a formidable editorial platform during 
their tenures as editors.  Much of this came from the quality of the research 
that they published.  But it also derived from their willingness to challenge 
Big Pharma’s insidious attempt to corrupt the independence of doctors, medical 
journals, medical education and patients.  Here were two highly esteemed physician-editors 
using the sheer credibility of research and their journal’s reputation to face 
down the multi-billion pharmaceutical industry, which has unleashed a veritable 
hydra of wily, unethical schemes to boost profits. 

Among them:  undisclosed industry payments to researchers to produce studies 
that make a new drug look good; undisclosed industry payments to leading physicians 
to teach courses that have the effect of promoting certain drugs and medical 
devices; undisclosed industry junkets and gifts to physicians to try to encourage 
more prescriptions of certain medications.  And so on.

One of the great achievements of the Occupy Wall Street movement, after only 
six weeks of protest, has been its unmasking of some deeply entrenched illusions 
about our rights of free speech, access to public spaces and the meaning of 
democracy. OWS has done this not with words alone (truth-telling tends to be 
consigned to the fringes of respectable opinion), but through mostly peaceful 
public confrontations of Power. 

As we saw in the Sixties, it takes such direct confrontations to force Power 
to reveal ugly truths that otherwise must be masked.  In the case of the Occupy 
protests, it is the truth that public spaces do not really belong to the citizenry; 
that private powers can curb dissent through procedural pretexts notwithstanding 
the First Amendment; and that democratic accountability as now practiced in 
the American empire is mostly a charade. ![][5]

When an outburst of real democracy emerges, as it has in hundreds of Occupy 
cities, it sends shockwaves of fear throughout the political establishment 
and business – because real democracy advances a whole set of interests that 
are anathema to the elite consensus and pseudo-democracy that now prevails.  

Blogger Namiza Naqvi makes some penetrating points about these issues in [a 
fascinating post][6] about the re-privatization of public spaces.  Naqvi writes: 

"An overarching issue is the public versus private ownership in everything 
from police to politicians to parks to property all over the planet in its 
cities and its villages. Whether it is a military or it is police the purpose 
seems to be to serve this end of privatization.

"The reaction by the law enforcement agencies to the [Occupy] protests have 
proven that people protesting the occupation or privatization of public property 
are viewed as criminals by the privately owned 21st century state..... In the 
eleventh hour of the 21st century in Times Square: I watched the police pushing 
the barricades even further in on the sidewalk cramming the demonstrators even 
further on an already narrow space and creating a potential crisis if the crowd 
got jammed in and someone fell or a stampede broke out because of all the police 
on horseback. The police steadily pushed back the barricades and diminished 
the space where protesters could stand and it seemed that the cops by doing 
this were forcing the crowds to overflow onto the street and creating the pretense 
for arresting people for not remaining within the designated area for the protests.  
As I watched this situation at Time Square I thought of all the fences and 
blockades and barricades in other parts of the world where people are squeezed 
off of their lands—their homelands—their homes razed to the ground and bulldozed 
turned into private properties---while the people are forced into dangerous 
environments—flood basins or coastlands or unwelcoming hostile cities in their 
own or foreign countries—in the path of disaster—or into cities where they 
have no chance of incomes—living in ghettos—begging, living on the streets 
homeless—only to be further abused and harassed by police and militaries.   
 

Enclosures of culture are inherently difficult to see because they are so seemingly 
isolated, gradual and invisible. A great example is the commercialization and 
commodification of play, one of our most instinctive and important human activities, 
especially in childhood.

So what happens when a giant octopus of a sports industry begins to professionalize 
and regiment the natural inclinations of play? What happens when a commercial 
harness is put around our sense of fun and recreation and goofing-around, so 
that it can become a powerful money-making machine? What happens to ethics 
and sportsmanship? What happens to the experience of childhood?

These were among the topics discussed at a small conference convened in September 
2009 by the Lake Placid Sport Forum in cooperation with the Aspen Institute. 
The event was one of the more fascinating side-trips that I have taken as a 
rapporteur. Coming from a wonky political background, I had never personally 
encountered so many deeply committed athletes in the same room.![][7]

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Hanging out at a small conference center and private home in Lake Placid, New 
York, I met Mark Messier and Mike Richter, two legendary former hockey stars 
with the New York Rangers. I also met Olympic track star Al Joyner and hockey 
player A.J. Mleczko, among other serious athletes. While each of these people 
were incredible physical specimens, they were, more to the point, incredibly 
committed competitors with an almost spiritual focus on the beauty of sports 
competitions and play itself.  At the conference there were leading sports 
journalists from _Sports Illustrated, _ESPN and _Business Week. _And there 
were a variety of coaches at all levels (professional, college, amateur), sports 
physicians and psychologists, journalists, community leaders and parents.

One of the key reasons that the American political system is so corrupt is 
because it is so expensive to run election campaigns. And one of the key reasons 
that campaigns are so costly is because political advertising on television 
is so expensive.

How bad is it? The latest word is about $3 billion. Local TV stations alone 
are expected to reap between $2.5 billion and $3.3 billion in political advertising 
in 2012, according to Ken Goldstein, who tracks political spending for Kantar 
Media CMAG. This represents about half of all the money that candidates and 
interest groups are likely to raise in the election cycle. All told, local 
TV stations are expected to siphon up between 42 and 48 percent of all the 
campaign monies raised.  

_To my readers -- my apologies for my infrequent posts over recent weeks.  
I’ve been overwhelmed with a writing deadline on my Commons Law Project, happily 
sidetracked by a vacation, and attending a conference.  But I promise to be 
posting more frequently in coming weeks and months._

My visit to the Vis Green Academy in Croatia last week taught me more about 
the transnational scourge of enclosure and the potential of the commons as 
a lingua franca for resistance.  The occasion was a major gathering of 200-plus 
Green Party activists and elected officials throughout eastern Europe, but 
especially Croatia.  Held on the lovely island of Vis, a former Yugoslavian 
military base until 1992, the gathering was entitled, “The Crisis of Political 
Imagination – and the Transformation of Green Politics."

The recurrent pattern of enclosure in Croatia, Slovenia, Macedonia, Herezogovina 
and other parts of the region is commercial development of urban public spaces 
and government collusion with speculators and developers in giving away prime 
coastal real estate.  Corruption is rife.  Political transparency is rare.  
Civil society is weak.

_I gave the following talk at the Caux Forum for Human Security in Montreux, 
Switzerland, on July 13, 2011.  _

The commons is, at its core, a very old – and a very new, recently rediscovered 
– system of governance for managing resources.  It has deep roots in history 
as a system of self-provisioning and mutual support.  It is also a way of being 
a human being that goes beyond the selfish, rational, utility-maximizing model 
of _homo economicus _that economists say we are.  The commons presumes that 
humans are more complex, and that more holistic, humane types of human behavior 
can be “designed into” our governance institutions. 

In its largest sense, the commons is about stewardship of the things that we 
own in common as human beings.  It’s about ensuring that we protect them and 
pass them on, undiminished, to future generations. 

Let me add, the commons is also a growing trans-national movement that manifests 
itself in many different ways.  The commons extends from cyberspace to the 
many commons of agro-ecological knowledge managed by indigenous peoples.  It 
reaches from the world’s city squares and parks that are the cradles of community, 
to the vast repositories of information and creative works that must be shared 
if they are to be kept alive. 

A massive international land grab is now underway as investors and national 
governments buy up millions of acres of farmlands in Africa, Asia and Latin 
America.  It amounts to an unprecedented and novel set of enclosures of worldwide 
land, much of it customary land that rural communities use and manage collectively.  
Hundreds of millions of rural poor people rely upon the land for their families' 
food, water and material -- but they don't have formal property rights in the 
land.  Those rights typically belong to the government, which is authorizing 
the sale of “unowned” lands or "wastelands" to investors, who will then use 
the land for market-based farming or biofuels production.

The implications for global hunger and poverty are enormous.  Instead of commoners 
having local authority to grow and harvest their own food, they are being thrown 
off the land so that large multinational corporations and investors can feed 
their own countries or make a speculative killing on the world land market.  
A commons is converted into a market, with all the attendant pathologies.

![][8]The 2008 financial crisis and the recent round of rising food prices 
on world markets have spurred much of the interest in buying up arable lands 
in poor countries.  Food-insecure countries figure they should take care of 
their own future even if it means depriving commoners in poor nations thousands 
of miles away.  So Saudi Arabia is spending $1 billion for 700,000 hectares 
of land in Africa for rice cultivation.  South Korea is buying up 700,000 hectares 
of African land as well.  India is assembling investment pools to buy up farmlands. 
 

_The New York Times_ has a front-page story today about a New York chef suing 
a competitor whom she claims ripped off her recipes and the look-and-feel of 
her restaurant. Rebecca Charles, the owner and chef of the Pearl Street Oyster 
Bar claims that Ed’s Lobster Bar copied “each and every element” of her restaurant, 
from the white marble bar, the gray wainscoting and even the Caesar salad. 
This is one of those dog-bites-man stories that is irresistible to the _Times_ 
-- a sophisticated chuckle for its highbrow readers -- but it does little to 
illuminate the wisdom of “intellectual property law” in this case or the specific 
legal arguments being made.
