At a time when representative democracy is increasingly revealed as ineffectual, 
phony or both – a kabuki theater of empty formalisms that disguise the offstage 
conspiracies of corporate/state elites – many people look to the Internet for 
salvation.  After all, the Internet is far more open, participatory and meritocratic 
than the closed, corporate-dominated process of our formal democracy. 

But even with these capacities, the Internet is not a solution because in the 
end the Internet is only a hosting platform.  A basic question must be answered:  
How should a more serious deliberative democracy be _structu__red_ in online 
spaces? ![][1]

Let the record show that the insurgent Pirate Party in Germany has made some 
significant progress on this problem.  Its new open source software platform, 
LiquidFeedback, is credited with helping the Pirates host more open, participatory 
and serious internal debates about party policies -- and to organize themselves 
to take action in conventional political arenas. 

The makers of Liquid Feedback characterize their platform in [a mission statement][2] 
as “a bridge between direct and representative democracy.”  They believe the 
software “has the potential to empower the ordinary members of mainstream political 
parties, making these parties more attractive to citizens and democracy stronger.”  
The software, released in version 2.0 in March 2012, is currently used by several 
associations and political parties. 

I’ve always been disappointed that the rich diversity of commons projects and 
scholarship that is exploding internationally cannot be readily seen – and 
what does exist tends to be written by and for academics. The [International 
Commons Conference][3] in Berlin in November 2010 brought this issue home by 
showing the amazing breadth of commons activism and thinking out there. The 
question is, How can someone tap into this knowledge? 

My friend and colleague Silke Helfrich and I have tried to remedy this problem 
by assembling a big anthology of essays on the commons by leading activists, 
scholars and project leaders.  I am happy to report that the German version 
of this book, edited by Helfrich and the Heinrich Böll Foundation, has just 
been published.  It’s called _[Commons:  For a Policy Beyond Market and State,][4]_ 
and it's available from the German publisher, transcript. 

The 526-page book is likely to be a ![][5]sourcebook on the commons for quite 
some time.  At least I hope so.  It contains 73 essays by authors who live 
in 30 countries around the world.  The essays focus on everything from commons-based 
abundance and free software to land enclosures and P2P urbanism.  There are 
essays by Peter Linebaugh on the history of the commons, Silvia Federici on 
women and the commons, Rob Hopkins on resilience, Liz Alden Wily on the international 
land grabs, Massimo de Angelis on capitalism and cooperation, and Hervé Le 
Crosnier on modern forms of enclosure, among many others. 

The point is to highlight the remarkable international diversity of commons 
projects, activism and theoretical thought.  The book features a number of 
essays by academics working in the Ostrom school of commons scholarship, but 
also many scholars from other traditions and independent activists. A major 
challenge was translating many essays from English and Spanish into German, 
and editing them all into a standard format.  A hearty congratulations to Silke 
and the Böll Foundationfor tackling this formidable task over the past year! 

_My commons colleague in Germany, Silke Helfrich, has pulled together a succinct, 
persuasive account of how the commons helps us get beyond the relentless growth 
imperatives of the contemporary economy.  She presented her ideas two weeks 
ago at the Attac Congress, “Beyond Growth,” in Berlin.  (A German version of 
her talk, “Commons Beyond Growth,” is available [here][6].)  _

_Below is Silke’s penetrating analysis about how the commons can help cultivate 
practical new models of provisioning without the pathologies of compulsive, 
unsustainable growth:_

**Summary**

* Commons reduce money-induced growth because they make us more independent of money. The more we produce commons, the less we or the state has to pay for goods.
* Commons reduce population-induced growth because they are associated with a multiplicity of sufficiency strategies which create [prosperity by sharing][7].
* Commons escape the growth compulsion, because all those things that are produced as commons, do not have to be made artificially scarce. And there is no incentive for artificial scarcity because commons are not produced as goods to be exchanged but they foster and maintain social relationships, satisfy needs and solve problems. Directly.

Thus far the vision of the future – but we have not got there yet. In the here 
and now a lot more must be thought through, discussed and fought for. Therefore, 
in what follows I will briefly give my reasoning.

The International Commons Conference in Berlin continues to generate some interesting 
follow-up work.  One of the most engaging is a series of videos shot by Alain 
Ambrosi of Remix the Commons.  The day after the conference, Alain interviewed 
ten commoners, including me, asking each of us the same questions, such as 
"What struck you most about this conference?"and "Would you say there is a 
commons movement?"![][8]

The [Remix the Commons project][9] is still a work-in-progress and won’t be 
fully operational for a few months.  However, in the meantime, two different 
series of videos are available:  “Define the Commons / Définir le Bien Commun 
/ Definir el Procomùn,” and  “Framing the Commons in Berlin.”  The latter consists 
of a series of  nine separate interviews with  Silke Helfrich (Germany), Michel 
Bauwens (Thailand), Julio Lambing (Germany), Beatriz Busaniche (Argentina), 
Frédéric Sultan (France), Valérie Peugeot (France), Rosa Maria Fernanda (Ecuador), 
Alberto Acosta (Ecuador), Hervé Le Crosnier (France), and me.  Each interview 
is conducted in the interviewee’s native language.![][10]

A new video introducing the idea of the commons had a rushed premiere at the 
end of the International Commons Conference, but has now been released on the 
Web in four languages.  Here's an invitation to pass it along and make it go 
viral.

["The Commons"][11] was produced by Christoph Knopp from Das Programm in Germany 
and the talented Berlin artist Burkhard Piller.  There are also versions in[ 
Spanish][12], [German][13] and [Italian][14], with a French one on the way.  
The animated line-drawings are wonderfully understated yet expressive.  In 
five short minutes, the neophyte can get an amusing introduction to the commons 
and the many areas in which it applies -- nature, culture, community and beyond.  

The conversations that I encountered at the International Commons Conference 
in Berlin, Germany, three weeks ago are still reverberating through my mind.  
I’m not sure if any of us really knew what[ a group of 180 self-styled commoners 
from 34 countries][15] would look like.  But just experiencing the transnational 
tableau of commoners – each with different voices and passions, but united 
by a commitment to the idea of the commons – was energizing and inspiring.  

The conference was sponsored by the H[einrich Böll Foundation][16] in cooperation 
with the [Commons Strategy Group ][17](of which I am a part) after months of 
planning, primarily by Silke Helfrich.  The event had an ambitious focus – 
“Constructing a Commons-Based Policy Platform” – that, in retrospect, was not 
entirely achieved.  There were just too many commoners meeting each other for 
the first time, each coming from different intellectual and cultural traditions, 
with no _lingua franca or _shared agenda yet.  We are still learning who were 
are, how we think and our aspirations for the commons.  (It was quite obvious, 
however, how we _feel._)

The conference's most significant achievement may have been the in-person convergence 
of so many committed commoners -- and the many new relationships and collaborations 
that have been spawned.  And even if the framing of the conference was ambitious, 
it was precisely what we need to be talking about.

Policy Platform," in Berlin, Germany, on November 1-2, 2010, convened by the 
Heinrich Boell Foundation in cooperation with the Commons Strategies Group. 
See also the conference wiki. 

After more than ten years of thinking and writing about the commons, I decided 
that it was time to strike off in some new directions, with some new partners, 
projects and ways of engaging the world.  I plan for my new blog, Bollier.org, 
to be the place where I can share my adventures and insights from my work on 
the commons.  A lot is going on that needs to be brought into focus, interpreted, 
shared and debated.  I hope that this site can serve that function.

Never before has there been so much diverse leadership and innovation in developing 
the commons paradigm.  The recent [International Commons Conference][3] in 
Berlin, Germany, on November 1-2 was a landmark convergence of many different 
approaches to the commons, from efforts to fortify traditional natural resource 
commons and pioneer "peer to peer urbanism" to new digital commons that aspire 
to develop a privacy-friendly alternative to Facebook, reinvent money and relocalize 
the economy.

_This is the third of a three-part installment of a report on the future of 
the commons, which is based on conversations at a retreat held at Crottorf 
Castle in Germany, in June 2009._

**9. Hermann Hatzfeldt on Sustainable Forestry**

During an afternoon break at the retreat, Hermann Hatzfeldt led the group on 
a walk through a forest preserve adjacent to Crottorf Castle. Hatzfeldt pioneered 
the a number of sustainable forestry practices on the 7,000 acres of nearby 
forest that he owns, the third largest privately owned forest in Germany. He 
explained that his management philosophy is to work in partnership with nature 
rather than trying to dictate to nature — because the results are more stable 
and productive over the long term. Hatzfeldt’s enterprise is essentially about 
the sustainable management of a common pool resource by a private owner.
