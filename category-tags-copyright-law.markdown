Hollywood and the record industry got some serious comeuppance when the European 
Parliament overwhelmingly defeated a copyright maximalist treaty by a 478 to 
39 vote on Wednesday.  Ouch!  This is a very sweet moment to savor. 

The content industries and trade representatives had been negotiating the so-called 
Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement for six years behind closed doors.  Civil 
society organizations were absolutely barred from the process even though industry 
players had full and complete access and participation.  The proposed changes 
to copyright law would have empowered copyright industries to throttle free 
speech on the Internet without due process; allow users to be barred access 
to Internet accounts; and force Internet service providers to act as copyright 
police by patrolling users’ web habits. 

The idea behind the ACTA treaty was to negotiate a new global standard of strict 
copyright standards.  It was also a sly tactical feint to use international 
policy venues to help impose stiff copyright rules on the US without having 
to go through the US Senate for treaty ratification (Obama could simply sign 
it as an “executive agreement”).  The point of this subterfuge was to avoid 
any bruising public debate about or political fallout from much-hated provisions 
of the agreement.

The defeat of ACTA is a sweet moment because arrogant trade reps and industry 
moguls had airily dismissed critics.  They thought that their insider access, 
lobbying dollars and propaganda campaigns could just ram the whole stinkin’ 
mess through.  But after last year's huge Internet mobilization against SOPA 
and PIPA – the Stop Online Privacy Act in the House and the Protect IP Act 
in the Senate – it was clear that Internet users were getting their act together 
as a political force.  That anti-SOPA, anti-PIPA effort stunned Congress; industry-backed 
legislation that had previously sailed through was stopped dead in its tracks.  
The spell of the entertainment industry's cozy influence-peddling was broken, 
at least for a while.

The publishers of research journals don’t get much attention because their 
products are not very exciting.  Mentions of _Science_ or _Nature_ do not exactly 
quicken the pulse.  But that doesn’t mean that the publishers of academic journals 
aren’t as predatory and profiteering as any Fortune 500 bank or oil company.  

It now appears that the major universities that generate so much of the world’s 
research (only to buy it back from publishers at huge mark-ups) could be getting 
ready to fight back.  Harvard University is publicly urging its faculty members 
to avoid publishing in journals that require paid access, and to publish instead 
in open access journals.  Open access literature can be defined as works that 
are digital, online, free of charge, and free of most copyright and licensing 
restrictions.

As the _Guardian _(UK) reports, the Harvard Faculty Advisory Council has sent 
[a memo to 2,100 professors and researchers][1] informing them that “major 
periodical subscriptions, especially to electronic journals published by historically 
key providers, cannot be sustained: continuing these subscriptions on their 
current footing is financially untenable. Doing so would seriously erode collection 
efforts in many other areas, already compromised.”

Wow! The save-the-Internet protests by Wikipedia, Google, Reddit, Boing Boing 
and hundreds of other websites marks a watershed moment in the evolution of 
networked political expression. Millions of Internet users learned that Congress 
actually can cripple the open Internet in the manner of authoritarian regimes, 
albeit in the name of copyright law.

Such mass politicization is powerful stuff. Within 24 hours, Senate Majority 
Leader Harry Reid postponed a scheduled vote on the “anti-piracy” Web censorship 
legislation known as SOPA and PIPA (Stop Online Piracy Act and Protect IP Act). 
The abrupt turnabout was widely regarded as a face-saving move for the benefit 
of Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy, a key sponsor of the bill.

Although protests had been building for weeks, the one-day shutdown of popular 
websites suddenly made visible a huge, alternative universe of citizens who 
are usually ignored in Washington, D.C. Suddenly the Old Guard could not broker 
their self-serving, insider deals in the shadows. Suddenly the Web demonstrated 
its power as a new sort of theater for organizing and representing the public 
to confront conventional governance.

Unbeknownst to millions of people recovering from their celebrations the night 
before, New Year's Day is a mini-celebration nested within a more famous holiday. 
Who among us realized that it was.... [“Public Domain Day.”][2][ ][2]This is 
the date on which copyrights are supposed to expire on millions of works from 
a previous generation. It's the date on which the proprietary controls lapse 
and creative works become born again as public domain artifacts that can be 
freely used by anyone, for any purpose.

Alas, nothing entered the public domain this year. In fact, nothing will enter 
the public domain until January 1, 2019, thanks to the twenty-year extension 
of copyright law that Congress enacted in 1998 at the behest of Disney Co. 
and other media giants. This may explain why Public Domain Day remains so obscure! 
Nonetheless, the redoubtable host of Public Domain Day – the Center for the 
Study of the Public Domain at Duke Law School – annually commemorates this 
date to educate the public about the theft of works that rightly belong to 
them.

For this year's “celebration,” we learn how the public domain has been impoverished 
through excessive copyright terms. Last week the Center provided a wonderful 
survey of the cultural heritage that remains locked up. [“What _Could_][3][ 
Have Entered the Public Domain on January 1, 2012?”][3] it asks. The answers 
include the films _The Body Snatchers_, _Rebel Without a Cause_, _Lady and 
the Tramp_.  Then there are all the books from that 1950s that you could copy 
and share for free: Vladimir Nabokov's Lollita; Rudolf Flesch’s _Why Johnny 
Can't Read_; J.R.R. Tolkien’s The _Return of the King_, the last book of his 
_Lord of Rings_ trilogy; and Edward Steichen’s famous book of photographs, 
_The Family of Man; __among many others._

Two recent developments suggest that the reactionary regime of maximalist copyright 
can still command a lot of raw political power to beat back commoners, flout 
legal principles and craft the law to its liking. Yet at the same time open 
networks and default norms of sharing are getting some serious traction these 
days, as two other developments attest. Could a post-reactionary world of free 
culture be at hand?

First, the bad news. A few weeks ago the EU extended the term of copyright 
protection for music recordings by another twenty years – an ignoble replay 
of what the U.S. Congress did in 1998 for U.S. copyright law. You may recall 
that the Disney Co. was determined to stop Mickey Mouse from entering the public 
domain, and the motion picture, recording and publishing industries were just 
as eager to reap a public giveaway worth billions of dollars.

If the copyright extension had not been adopted, lots of British music recordings from the 1960s from the Beatles to the early Stones and many others were expected to enter the public domain in 2012. Now _there's _a chilling thought: music that's still popular becoming free!  Alternatively, 
the artists themselves could begin to distribute the music themselves, rather 
than having to let the record labels have exclusive rights for another 20 years. 
 

When making the case that the terms of copyright protection are too long – 
currently, an author’s lifetime plus 70 years – it is not uncommon to note 
that “Happy Birthday to You” is still under copyright.  Yes, that ubiquitous 
little ditty of folk culture is a piece of private property.  It should inspire 
a fair bit of outrage that a song first published in 1893 will remain copyrighted 
until 2030. 

While you won’t get dunned for singing it at home, the private ownership of 
the song means that many restaurants such as Red Lobster and Outback Steakhouse 
have had to develop their own “birthday songs” in order to avoid paying a “public 
performance” licensing fee to ASCAP.  If a documentary film or TV broadcast 
(such as the news) carries a snippet of “Happy Birthday,” the producers must 
pay a fee to Summy-Birchard, the current owner of the song, which is also a 
subsidiary of Warner/Chappell Music Inc., which is the publishing arm of Warner 
Music Group, which itself is owned by Time Warner.   

In the 1990s, a variety of industries dependent on copyright, trademark and 
patent law decided that the Internet and new digital technologies were getting 
way too dangerous. Upstart competitors with innovative business models were 
starting to invade well-established markets.  Worse, ordinary people were starting 
to bypass the market system and challenge the supremacy of copyright and patent 
law (and to a lesser extent, trademark law).  People began to create their 
own freely shareable alternatives using free software, co-production of content 
and virtually free distribution.

And so it was that the corporate giants of information and culture staked out 
the high ground of “property rights.”  It would be t![][4]he citadel from which 
they would defend their entrenched business models and fight the “dangers” 
of digital networks.  The result has been the IP Wars, a sprawling set of political, 
economic and cultural conflicts that continue to rage today. 

It is a far-ranging conflagration that affects dozens of creative and cultural 
enterprises -- film production and distribution, musical performance and recording, 
book publishing, photography and video production, pharmaceutical development, 
scientific research, scholarly publishing and databases, among many other arenas. 

There has also been a strenuous backlash to IP industries.  People with HIV/AIDS 
have risen up to fight the broad patent claims of the pharmaceutical industry, 
which has made life-saving drugs unaffordable to millions of people in need.  
Hackers have organized to resist the proprietary lock-down of software code, 
and insisted upon basic human freedom to copy and share their code.  Subsistence 
farmers have resisted patent laws that promote genetically modified crops and 
threaten their seed-sharing practices. 

Those antic law professors who gave us [_Bound by Law__ _][5]– a glorious superhero-comic 
treatment of the fair use doctrine in filmmaking -- are at it again!  Forget 
DC Comics.  I want my IP Comics!  Keith Aoki, James Boyle and Jennifer Jenkins 
are apparently out to build a franchise by translating the arcane monstrosities 
of copyright law into clever, hilarious and downright educational comic books.  

Their latest offering, due out in the spring or summer of 2011, is [_Theft!  
A History of Music -- Musical Borrowing from Plato to Hip-Hop._][6] Aoki, a 
professor of law at the UC-Davis School of Law, is the graphic artist for the 
comic book.  Boyle and Jenkins  -- both professors at Duke Law School – researched, 
wrote and designed it.  Boyle is the former Chairman of Creative Commons and 
co-founder of its spinoff project, Science Commons.  Jenkins heads the Center 
for the Study of the Public Domain.

Ludwig von Beethoven died 183 years ago. So why is his music still locked behind 
copyrights and not available for free to everyone? Because even if the music 
itself is in the public domain, the _recordings_ of his music, or perhaps the 
_sheet music_ (with special arrangements or notation) can be copyrighted by 
the orchestras that perform the music or the composers who notate it.

And so if you buy a CD of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony, you need to pay your 
$15 or so to the record label, distributor and retailer, the orchestra and 
all the lawyers and marketers and other irregulars with a finger in the pie. 
And then, in the end, you can only listen to the music. You can't legally download 
it, share it with friends over the Internet, do a remix of it, play it in a 
restaurant as background music, or use it as a soundtrack to a film.

It is a sign of the predatory nature of markets today that a tradition that 
goes back 4,500 years now needs to affirmatively defend itself as a common 
legacy of humankind. Yes, the latest endangered resource is -- yoga.

Yoga was developed in India as a physical and spiritual practice for everyone. 
The breathing known as _pranayama_ is perhaps the most elemental aspect of 
human existence. But wouldn't you know it -- all sorts of scheming entrepreneurs 
now want to convert yoga into "intellectual property."

The pioneer in this endeavor was Bikram Choudhury, born in Calcutta, who came 
to the U.S. and began to franchise his trademarked yoga studios with his own 
distinctive adaptations of the ancient practice. Bikram's claimed a copyright 
in his “original” sequence of 26 postures that his clients perform in 105-degree 
rooms. Anyone who “stole” his copyrighted yoga postures for commercial purposes 
would then be liable for damages, he claimed.
