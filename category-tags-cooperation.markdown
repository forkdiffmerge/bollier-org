As if recovering from the binge of market triumphalism that crested in 2008, 
the Zeitgeist is now unleashing a steady stream of new works on cooperation.  
The rediscovery of this aspect of our humanity is long overdue and incredibly 
important, given the deformities of thinking that economics has inflicted on 
public consciousness.  So I was excited to learn that the distinguished sociologist 
[Richard Sennett][1]had written a new book about cooperation, [_Together:  
The Rituals Pleasures and Politics of Cooperation_][2] (Yale University Press).

The pleasures of a book by Sennett is its extreme erudition, lightly worn and 
combined with a thoughtful personal voice and political conscience.  Sennett, 
now 69, teaches at the London School of Economics and New York University, 
after a lifetime of studying urban culture, class consciousness, labor and 
politics.  _Together_ eschews the social science jargon that imprisons so many 
of Sennett’s colleagues, offering an engaging, far-ranging and subtle meditation 
on how human beings learn to cooperate.  He draws upon evolutionary science, 
sociological research, a life of field research, and his personal experiences 
as a celebrated political cosmopolitan.

The great value of _Together _is its creation of a fresh vocabulary for thinking 
more systematically about how cooperation occurs, and does not occur, in contemporary 
life.  This is quite a radical act considering the general orientation of economics 
and public policy, which tend to presume that we are all individuals living 
in isolation, as disconnected libertarian monads.  It's utterly false, of course, 
but we do not have a very developed or precise public narrative for asserting 
the opposite.  Sennett supplies one.  

Every day all sorts of fascinating, commons-relevant stories flow through my 
computer. I thought I'd showcase a few of the more notable ones. 

**Silent Protocol Wars**

_Radical Philosophy_, a UK journal, has a fascinating essay, [“A Tale of Two 
Worlds,” ][4] by Nicolás Mendoza, about the “silent protocol wars” that websites 
like WikiLeaks, 4Chan and the Anonymous hackers are embroiled in with nation-states. 
The “de-localized collaborative community” is arguably the biggest social innovation 
of the Internet. It is the source of what Mendoza calls a “rogue episteme” 
– alternative, sometimes-subversive ways of seeing and engaging with the world. 
But will these alternative networked communities be made technically impossible 
if they continue to challenge the authority and control of the nation-state? 
Recent provocations by WikiLeaks (the US Embassy Cables leak) and Anonymous' 
retaliatory acts raise the question.  The implications for the civic sovereignty 
of citizens elsewhere around the world is huge.

Mendoza writes: 

“There is no remote corner of the Internet not dependent on protocols,” Laura DeNardis insists. What DeNardis stresses is the ultimate preponderance of the technical over the social protocol. Lessig inaugurated this line of thinking when he famously stated “Code is Law.” But protocol runs deeper than software: if code is law then protocol is the 
constitution. This is why, as long as attention is diverted toward anything 
spectacular (like tactical and superficial DdoS [denial of service] attacks), 
governments can start the demolition of the protocols that grant the possibility 
of autonomy to the network. In reaction to the release of the US Embassy Cables 
[by WikiLeaks], the UN called for the creation of a group that would end the 
current multi-stakeholder nature of the Internet Governance Forum (IGF) to 
give the last word on Internet control to the governments of the world. 

Governments, of course, want to assure their own capacity to conduct surveillance, 
censorship and control. The question is whether the autonomous communities 
as embodied by WikiLeaks and Anonymous (who act as a vanguard for the larger, 
less politicized set of Internet users) can survive the protocol wars. “This 
is where the war stands to be won,” writes Mendoza: “in the building of autonomous 
structures of all sorts (structures that bypass and outcompete existing ones) 
on top of other new structures until the entire old world is unnecessary.” 

Sometimes it just takes a determined set of commoners to get the job done. 
Impatient with the lethargy of the federal government in making its own films 
and videos available online, info-activist Carl Malamud has launched the [International 
Amateur Scanning League.][5] Dozens of volunteers are digitizing government-produced 
DVDs on everything from agricultural advice to presidential addresses, and 
putting them on the Internet.

Some 200,000 such DVDs are nominally available to the American people, but 
unless you live in Washington, D.C., and can personally visit the National 
Archives, your only option is to buy a copy from Amazon.com. The Scanning League 
aims to liberate those videos for everyone — for free.

As the [New York Times][6] (March 15) tells the story:

The venerable English pub has long been a place where everyone from the businessman 
to the housewife to the student, factory worker and vicar could meet as equals 
— a social commons that reflected the neighborhood and its idiosyncrasies. 
Over the past twenty years or more, however, large corporations have consolidated 
the ownership of British pubs so that some companies own thousands of them. 
The trend has accelerated in recent years, forcing hundreds of independent 
local pubs to close.

Now, as [The Independent (London) reports,][7] local beer-drinkers are fighting 
back. They are buying their beloved local pubs and converting them into cooperatives 
— and gaining greater control over how the pub is run, diversifying the beers 
sold, and preserving the pubs for their communities and children. (Thanks to 
Ally Marks for the tip to this story!)

Do humans have a natural propensity to form commons? That is certainly one 
way to interpret recent findings by scientists studying the innate behaviors 
of babies. It turns out that very young children show a natural willingness 
to help other out and cooperate.

While all of us have healthy dollops of ego and selfishness, experiments have 
shown that children have an almost reflexive desire to help others even before 
parents and culture begin to shape those instincts. The cooperative impulse 
can be seen in children across cultures, and it is a trait that our closest 
evolutionary ancestor, primates, do not have. In one experiment, for example, 
when an adult pretends to be searching for lost objects, infants will start, 
12 months old, to point at the “lost” objects.

Property law is not exactly a riveting subject, and law professors are not 
usually good storytellers. But in his new book _The Gridlock Economy,_ Michael 
Heller, a professor at Columbia Law School, has written one of the most intelligent 
and accessible critiques of how overly broad property rights can be harmful 
not only to the commons, but to the market.

If you care to learn why cell phone service is so bad in the United States, 
why breakthrough medical treatments cannot be taken to market, and how holdouts 
can stymie valuable real estate development, _The Gridlock Economy_ helps locate 
a core problem: the fragmentation of individual property rights and the paralysis 
that results. Though economists like to tout property rights as a wonder-cure 
for virtually everything that ails us, Heller explains how all sorts of innovation 
and market growth is killed in the cradle simply because there are too many 
rights-holders with too many divergent concerns.
