On the [Al Jazeera website][1], Michel Bauwens of the [P2P Foundation][2] has 
a terrific big-picture assessment of the impressive growth of the sharing economy 
and peer production, and its serious long-term implications for capitalism.    

He starts by explaining how commons-based peer production is rapidly expanding.  
It is no longer confined to the familiar, robust worlds of free software, wikis, 
the blogosphere, and social networking in cyberspace.  Peer production has 
moved on to various physical realms.  It can be seen in such innovations as 
open source manufacturing, which has produced Wikispeed, a 100 mpg car built 
by a team of volunteers in just three months, and Arduino, the open-source 
electronics prototyping platform.  It can also be seen in various crowdsourcing 
and social lending platforms, such as Kickstarter (which I recently learned 
channeled more money to artists in 2011 than the U.S. National Endowment for 
the Arts).

Peer production has also spawned a whole new sector of “collaborative consumption.” 
 This consists of organized forms of swapping and bartering, car-sharing, CouchSurfing 
and other lifestyle practices and innovative markets based on sharing.  The 
point in most cases is to reduce one’s dependence on the market and live a 
more social, convivial life.  The goal is not acquisition and ownership, but 
access and use.

The infrastructure for starting and maintaining new commons just got a big 
boost in Spain with the founding of [Goteo.org][3], a new crowdfunding website. 
The explicit mission of Goteo.org is to help finance and support “the independent 
development of creative and innovative initiatives that contribute to the common 
good, free knowledge, and open code.”

The site is obviousy inspired by the crowdfunding website Kickstarter and other 
distributed-funding innovations, but Goteo.org differs in being dedicated exclusively 
to funding open-source and commons-related projects. It is also dedicared to 
fostering distributed collaboration on proposed and ongoing projects.

Most of the Goteo.org website is in Spanish, but here is [an English FAQ][4] describing 
the project. Geoteo sees itself as “a platform for investing in 'feeder capital' 
that supports projects with social, cultural, scientific, educational, technological, 
or ecological objectives that generate new opportunities for the improvement 
of society and the enrichment of community goods and resources.” 

The City of Linz in Austria has long been in the forefront of civic-minded 
uses of the Internet and digital technologies.  In 1979, it started the Ars 
Electronica festival, a showcase for cutting-edge experiments in digital and 
media arts, which was followed in 1987 with the Prix Ars Electronica, a prestigious 
international award for the most exemplary, pioneering websites and computer 
art.  In 2005 the city built 118 wifi hotspots in public squares so that citizens 
could have free access to the Internet.  Through the [Public Space Server project][5], 
Linz began to provide personal e-mail inboxs on the city’s servers and to host 
non-commercial content on the Internet.

So it is exciting to learn that the City of Linz is now trying to take the 
free culture/open platform sensibility to a whole new level.  It wants to use 
the Internet to transform city politics, governance and culture into a vast 
ecosystem of commons.  Last July city officials announced that it would launch 
[Open Commons Region Linz][6], a series of region-wide initiatives that aspires 
to make local information and creativity as open, accessible and shareable 
as possible.  The Green Party and politically minded digital leaders believe 
that by making it easy for citizens to access and share knowledge on a local 
basis, it will stimulate digital innovators to produce locally useful information 
tools while encouraging greater civic engagement and more robust economic development. 

One of the recurrent questions that people have about the future of the Internet 
is, _So how are creators going to make money in the digital environment?_  
The good news is that the Free Culture Forum – a Barcelona-based international 
gathering of free software, free culture, creators and policy activists – has 
addressed these very questions in a major “how to” guide that was just released.    

In “Sustainable Models for Creativity in the Digital Age,” the FCF affirms:  

We can no longer put off re-thinking the economic structures that have been 
producing, financing and funding culture up until now.  Many of the old models 
have become anachronistic and detrimental to civil society.  The aim of this 
document is to promote innovative strategies to defend and extend the sphere 
in which human creativity and knowledge can prosper freely and sustainably. 

This report is aimed at policy reformers, citizens and free/libre culture activists 
to provide them practical tools to understand the policy options and revenue 
models, and the importance of the commons in the new digital marketplaces. 

Two weeks ago,[ I blogged about how Brazil is turning its back on the free 
software and free culture movements][7], and moving to defend entrenched, proprietary 
cultural industries:  a terribly disappointing turn of events.  Now there is 
an international petition being circulated in Portuguese, French, Spanish and 
English to express widespread dismay at this recent turn of events. A copy 
of the petition is below.  You can sign it by going to [this website.][8]

The petition follows:

_(English translation of the [Carta de representantes da sociedade civil à 
Presidente Dilma Roussef e à Ministra da Cultura Ana Buarque de Hollanda][9])_ 

In the 1990s, a variety of industries dependent on copyright, trademark and 
patent law decided that the Internet and new digital technologies were getting 
way too dangerous. Upstart competitors with innovative business models were 
starting to invade well-established markets.  Worse, ordinary people were starting 
to bypass the market system and challenge the supremacy of copyright and patent 
law (and to a lesser extent, trademark law).  People began to create their 
own freely shareable alternatives using free software, co-production of content 
and virtually free distribution.

And so it was that the corporate giants of information and culture staked out 
the high ground of “property rights.”  It would be t![][10]he citadel from 
which they would defend their entrenched business models and fight the “dangers” 
of digital networks.  The result has been the IP Wars, a sprawling set of political, 
economic and cultural conflicts that continue to rage today. 

It is a far-ranging conflagration that affects dozens of creative and cultural 
enterprises -- film production and distribution, musical performance and recording, 
book publishing, photography and video production, pharmaceutical development, 
scientific research, scholarly publishing and databases, among many other arenas. 

There has also been a strenuous backlash to IP industries.  People with HIV/AIDS 
have risen up to fight the broad patent claims of the pharmaceutical industry, 
which has made life-saving drugs unaffordable to millions of people in need.  
Hackers have organized to resist the proprietary lock-down of software code, 
and insisted upon basic human freedom to copy and share their code.  Subsistence 
farmers have resisted patent laws that promote genetically modified crops and 
threaten their seed-sharing practices. 

The debate over the commons used to focus on how to protect shared resources 
from private predators.  Now, increasingly, the focus is shifting to how the 
commons and market forces can constructively work together while preserving 
the integrity of the commons.  That is to say, the focus is on how to preserve 
the social relationships and free flows of information that constitute the 
commons while permitting some sort of monetization and/or developing external 
revenue sources. 

I consider this whole conversation is a significant “developmental stage” in 
the evolution of the commons:  how to develop a sustainable balance between 
commons and markets?  This sort of talk was much in evidence at the [Free Culture 
Forum][11] in Barcelona in late October; at the [International Commons Conference][12] 
in Berlin on November 1-2; and most notably at the [“Economies of the Commons”][13] 
conference hosted by the De Balie Center in Amsterdam on November 11-13.  The 
tagline for the latter conference put it well:  “Paying the cost of making 
things free.”

As commercial interests try to convert what has essentially been a commons 
into a total market order, the Internet is experiencing a mid-life crisis.  
The open Internet is in the process of being enclosed by a variety of commercial 
forces.  The struggle for political and creative freedom is getting more urgent 
and complicated as commercial forces try to “develop” the Internet.

The challenge for people who believe in free culture is to reinterpret the 
core values of the Internet and somehow develop new ways to protect them in 
today’s more complicated environment.

One of the big problems in science is the proliferation of databases whose 
content is technically incompatible or legally proprietary in some fashion 
— and therefore unable to be used by others in their research. For years a 
number of smart, committed scientists, law scholars and techies have grappled 
with the problem of making data accessible and re-useable. Now they have released 
a blueprint for doing so.

The [Panton Principles for Open Data in Science][18] is a major effort to articulate 
a clear definition of "open data" and help scientists make the right choices 
in trying to make their data “open.” The principles set forth the general steps 
that scientists should take to create more effective and sustainable data commons. 

The preamble to the Panton Principles reads:

_Science is based on building on, reusing and openly criticizing the published 
body of scientific knowledge. For science to effectively function, and for 
society to reap the full benefits from scientific endeavors, it is crucial 
that science data be made open._
