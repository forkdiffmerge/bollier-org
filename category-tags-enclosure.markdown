Unbeknownst to millions of people recovering from their celebrations the night 
before, New Year's Day is a mini-celebration nested within a more famous holiday. 
Who among us realized that it was.... [“Public Domain Day.”][1][ ][1]This is 
the date on which copyrights are supposed to expire on millions of works from 
a previous generation. It's the date on which the proprietary controls lapse 
and creative works become born again as public domain artifacts that can be 
freely used by anyone, for any purpose.

Alas, nothing entered the public domain this year. In fact, nothing will enter 
the public domain until January 1, 2019, thanks to the twenty-year extension 
of copyright law that Congress enacted in 1998 at the behest of Disney Co. 
and other media giants. This may explain why Public Domain Day remains so obscure! 
Nonetheless, the redoubtable host of Public Domain Day – the Center for the 
Study of the Public Domain at Duke Law School – annually commemorates this 
date to educate the public about the theft of works that rightly belong to 
them.

For this year's “celebration,” we learn how the public domain has been impoverished 
through excessive copyright terms. Last week the Center provided a wonderful 
survey of the cultural heritage that remains locked up. [“What _Could_][2][ 
Have Entered the Public Domain on January 1, 2012?”][2] it asks. The answers 
include the films _The Body Snatchers_, _Rebel Without a Cause_, _Lady and 
the Tramp_.  Then there are all the books from that 1950s that you could copy 
and share for free: Vladimir Nabokov's Lollita; Rudolf Flesch’s _Why Johnny 
Can't Read_; J.R.R. Tolkien’s The _Return of the King_, the last book of his 
_Lord of Rings_ trilogy; and Edward Steichen’s famous book of photographs, 
_The Family of Man; __among many others._

Borrowing from the future without understanding the actual risks, and then 
spending the money carelessly?  Sounds like Wall Street all over again. But 
this time, it's a little-known tax mechanism known as tax-increment financing, 
or TIF.

TIF is an ingenious local economic development tool that lets city governments 
borrow against future tax revenues for a given area of town in order to invest 
in new projects today. While TIFs can work as intended and spur development, 
they are also highly vulnerable to abuse because their details and implementation 
are shrouded in complexity: a convenient temptation for expedient politicians. 

TIF lets politicians borrow money from the city's future tax base, and then 
spend it on development projects with minimal public or legislative oversight. 
The scheme is sustained by the the supposition that the TIF bond money, if 
well-spent today, will pay for itself with future tax revenues generated by 
new development.

One of the treats at the Vis Green Academy in Croatia last week was seeing 
an exhibit of photographs by Marina Kelava, of Bjelovar, Croatia, who works 
as a journalist and photojournalist for Croatian Internet magazine [H-Alter.org][3], 
which focuses mainly on environmental issues.  The exhibit included a number 
of photos documenting various enclosures of the commons in Croatia as well 
as photos taken while covering large international events, from the UN Climate 
Change Conference in Copenhagen and the World Social Forum to the beginning 
of Radovan Karadzic’s trial at the International Criminal Tribunal. 

Kelava graduated from the Faculty of Political Sciences, University of Zagreb, 
with a degree in journalism.  A larger collection of her photos can be seen 
on Facebook at [Marina Kelava Photography][4]. 

I met Marina when she interviewed me for H-Alter.org.  Then I saw her photos 
on the wall and was impressed by their power in depicting the personal, social 
and emotional dimensions of commoning, the social practices of defending and 
celebrating a community's shared wealth.  The photos are simultaneously political 
and human, which is not always an easy thing to combine in rich, subtle ways.  
Kelava's photos do.

golf project is planned and the civil initiative "Srdj is Ours" is fighting 
against it.

Adam Greenfield, the founder of [Urbanscale][6], a consulting firm concerned 
with “design for networked cities and citizens,” gave a fascinating talk at 
a symposium called [Hyper-Public][7],  convened by the Berkman Center for Internet 
and Society at Harvard University. 

The conference was about “designing private and public space in the connected 
world,” and therefore focused a lot on how urban spaces and the Web ought to 
be designed so as to protect people’s privacy rights while enhancing public 
social life.  Greenfield is the author of _Everyware: The Dawning Age of Ubiquitous 
Computing_, and former head of design direction for service and user-interface 
design at Nokia.

Unbeknownst to most of us, the steady advance of digital technologies is starting 
to make buildings, billboards, traffic barriers and other urban infrastructure 
“declarative” objects -- if not interactive, networked objects.  For example, 
the Tower of London now has its own Twitter account so that it can now tell 
potential visitors, “I am opening at [name a time]...” and “I am closing after...” 
(The Twitter account @towerbridge, an unofficial one started by a fan, was 
displaced when the museum itself [asserted a trademark claim on the name][8].)  
 

_The post below is excerpted from James K. Boyce's acceptance speech, "__The 
Environment as Our Common Heritage," __for the [Fair Sharing of the Common 
Heritage Award][9], presented by Project Censored and the Media Freedom Foundation 
in Berkeley, California.  It originally appeared on the [TripleCrisis.com][10] 
website, on February 10, 2011.  Jim teaches ecological economics, among other 
things, at UMass Amherst, and has been a long-time defender of the commons._ 

What does it mean to say that the environment is our “common heritage”? On 
one level this is a simple statement of fact: when we are born, we come into 
a world that is not of our own making. The air we breathe, the water we drink, 
the natural resources on which our livelihoods depend, and the accumulated 
knowledge and information that underpin our ability to use these resources 
wisely – all these come to us as gifts of creation passed on to us by preceding 
generations and enriched by their innovations and creativity.

Yet once we take seriously – as I do – the proposition that this common heritage 
belongs in common and equal measure to us all, we move beyond a positive statement 
of facts to a normative declaration of ethics. We move beyond an understanding 
of what _is _to an assertion of what _ought to be. _

To say that the environment belongs in common and equal measure to us all does 
not mean that we have inherited a free gift with no strings attached. For our 
common heritage carries with it a common responsibility: the responsibility 
to share the environment fairly amongst all who are alive today, and the responsibility 
to care for it wisely to ensure that our children, our grandchildren, and the 
generations who follow will share fairly in our common heritage, too.

Every few months I find myself circling back to writings by Ivan Illich, the 
iconoclastic Catholic priest who decried the institutionalization of life and 
the great promise of “vernacular domains” as a source of regeneration.

I came back to Illich this time via a chapter about him in a book by Trent 
Schroyer, _Beyond Western Economics:  Remembering Other Economic Cultures _(Routledge, 
2009).  The chapter is easily one of the most illuminating things I’ve read 
about Illich and his critiques of modernity.

The vernacular domain, as Illich calls it, is the realm of everyday life in 
which people create and negotiate their own sense of things – how they should 
educate themselves, how they should embrace their spirituality, how they should 
manage the resources they need and love.  Vernacular culture consists of those 
spaces that exist for self-determination in the broadest sense of the term.  
As Schroyer puts it:

Coming to terms with the commons means a willingness to learn a new language 
and the alien worldview that it makes possible.  That is one of the great lessons 
that I have gleaned from reading histories of English commons and the enclosure 
movement. 

I realized this anew upon reading an essay by historian Peter Linebaugh, “Enclosures 
from the Bottom Up,” in the December 2010 issue of _Radical History Review_.  
(Alas, the essay is locked behind a paywall, but fortunately, a website called 
[“Envisioning a Post-Capitalist Order:  A Collaborative Project”][11] -- which 
_Radical History Review _has a hand in – has posted a [downloadable pdf version 
of the essay here][12].)   

[![][13]][14]Linebaugh -- the great scholar of the commons and author of _The 
Magna Carta Manifesto_ (University of California Press, 2006) – has a way of 
conjuring up entire ways of knowing that have disappeared.  I was struck by 
two passages describing the folkways of commoners. The first links “body-snatching” 
with the commons, a conjunction that made me start.  It turns out that, amidst 
a civil rebellion in Otmoor, near Oxford, England, in the 1830s, a rallying 
cry of the commoners was “Damn the body snatchers!”  

There's a reason why the financial dealings of the Federal Reserve are so arcane.  
It helps in ripping off the American people.  [Don Dzombak of The Motley Fool 
][15]has posted a very funny[ homemade video][16] in the style of South Park 
that explains in a simple dialogue how the American people get ripped off when 
buying U.S. Treasury bonds.  ![][17]

Two barely animated cartoon characters resembling stuffed bears are standing 
in a field talking in robotic, tech-modulated voices about the Federal Reserve 
Board's asinine policies.  I'll pick up the dialogue midstream:

Imagine that you're a company that is increasingly besieged by complaints that 
your heavily advertised junk foods and sugary drinks are contributing to obesity, 
diabetes and other health problems. The First Lady has even gotten into the 
act, making "eating healthy" a personal priority. Naturally, the company wants 
to neutralize public criticisms about its unhealthy products and refurbish 
its corporate image.

What better way than to buy a slice of respectability and high-minded objectivity 
from an Ivy League school -- say, Yale University?

That’s exactly what PepsiCo did recently when it announced that it would fund 
a graduate fellowship in nutritional science at the Yale School of Medicine. 
The masters or PhD student will explore "obesity, diabetes and metabolic syndrome." 
The depressing part is, Yale was only too eager to play along and sell its 
name for peanuts. It will receive $250,000 over the course of five years. For 
this, the dean of Yale School of Medicine, Robert Alpern, praised "PepsiCo's 
commitment to improving health through proper nutrition" and called PepsiCo's 
partnership with Yale "a visionary investment in the future of science."

What happens when a market-based agricultural juggernaut invades a 9,000-year-old 
system of commons-based maize production in Mexico? What are the on-the-ground 
consequences? How have the farmers using traditional agriculture responded? 
Journalist Peter Canby offers a stunning account of this saga in his well-reported 
piece in The Nation, [“Retreat to Subsistence.”][18] Highly recommended reading.
