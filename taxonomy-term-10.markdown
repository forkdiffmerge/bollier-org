The publishers of research journals don’t get much attention because their 
products are not very exciting.  Mentions of _Science_ or _Nature_ do not exactly 
quicken the pulse.  But that doesn’t mean that the publishers of academic journals 
aren’t as predatory and profiteering as any Fortune 500 bank or oil company.  

It now appears that the major universities that generate so much of the world’s 
research (only to buy it back from publishers at huge mark-ups) could be getting 
ready to fight back.  Harvard University is publicly urging its faculty members 
to avoid publishing in journals that require paid access, and to publish instead 
in open access journals.  Open access literature can be defined as works that 
are digital, online, free of charge, and free of most copyright and licensing 
restrictions.

As the _Guardian _(UK) reports, the Harvard Faculty Advisory Council has sent 
[a memo to 2,100 professors and researchers][1] informing them that “major 
periodical subscriptions, especially to electronic journals published by historically 
key providers, cannot be sustained: continuing these subscriptions on their 
current footing is financially untenable. Doing so would seriously erode collection 
efforts in many other areas, already compromised.”

It’s no secret that digital technologies and networks are becoming tremendously 
disruptive to academia by introducing new ways of doing research, publishing, 
teaching and collaborating with peers.  But few universities have shown much 
gusto for tackling this very difficult topic, let alone trying to devise some 
working solutions.  So USC deserves some credit for a serious and sophisticated 
one-day symposium on the topic in January 2011. 

Hosted by the USC Office of Research and the Norman Lear Center at the USC 
Annenberg School for Communication & Journalism, the event convened a highly 
interdisciplinary set of participants – from engineering, social sciences, 
medical fields and the humanities.  The ideas was to explore some of the innovative 
ways that academic research is now occurring and what university administrations 
should do in response.  Among the questions posed at the symposium: 

* How do you get credit toward tenure or promotion if your work as an academic is part of a vast online collaboration? 
* How should peer review be done now that online platforms make it easy to invite talented outsiders from other disciplines, and even non-academics, to review work?   
* With everyone staring into the computer screens, how should research institutions design real-world spaces so that people can actually have serendipitous in-person encounters and collaborations?

I served as rapporteur for that event, and now the final report has been published.

_I delivered the following remarks -- "The Marginalization of the Commons and 
What To Do About It" -- at the 13th Biennial conferece of the International 
Association for the Study of the Commons, in Hyderabad, India, on January 12, 
2011._

The commons is of keen interest to me because of its great potential to transform 
how we talk about economics, politics, governance and culture.  Or more to 
the point, it can be an active, creative force for positive change in people’s 
lives.    

The focus of the conference today is the structural forces that are marginalizing 
the commons and disempowering commoners.  Why is it that the commons is so 
often excluded from official policy discussions about how to manage resources 
and improve people’s lives?  Why are the State and the Market seen as the only 
two serious realms of action – while the commons is often patronized or dismissed 
as inconsequential, if it is considered at all?  

 

**Academia as a Commons:**

**The Promise of Digital Technologies ****at Amherst College and the Five Colleges** 

_The following remarks were made by David Bollier, Croxton Lecturer at the 
Robert Frost Library, Amherst College, on April 26, 2010._

I am particularly pleased to be delivering these remarks in Frost Library, 
ground zero for my intellectual wanderlust as an Amherst student, class of 
1978.  Libraries are also a deep part of my family tradition.  My father was 
for many years a librarian at Yale Divinity School Library, and so it pleases 
me to be able to do my part to support my local library. 

Allow me to make a quick introduction of myself so you can get a sense of my 
mission in life.  I am not an academic, although I am currently pretending 
to be one as the Croxton Lecturer here at Amherst College.  I’m teaching Sociology 
42, a seminar called “The Rise of the Commons,” which draws upon my extensive 
writing and thinking about the commons.            

Imagine that you're a company that is increasingly besieged by complaints that 
your heavily advertised junk foods and sugary drinks are contributing to obesity, 
diabetes and other health problems. The First Lady has even gotten into the 
act, making "eating healthy" a personal priority. Naturally, the company wants 
to neutralize public criticisms about its unhealthy products and refurbish 
its corporate image.

What better way than to buy a slice of respectability and high-minded objectivity 
from an Ivy League school -- say, Yale University?

That’s exactly what PepsiCo did recently when it announced that it would fund 
a graduate fellowship in nutritional science at the Yale School of Medicine. 
The masters or PhD student will explore "obesity, diabetes and metabolic syndrome." 
The depressing part is, Yale was only too eager to play along and sell its 
name for peanuts. It will receive $250,000 over the course of five years. For 
this, the dean of Yale School of Medicine, Robert Alpern, praised "PepsiCo's 
commitment to improving health through proper nutrition" and called PepsiCo's 
partnership with Yale "a visionary investment in the future of science."

_David Bollier has been the Croxton Lecturer at Amherst College for the past 
semester, teaching a course, “The Rise of the Commons.” Below are remarks that 
he delivered at the Robert Frost Library on April 26, 2010._

I realize that any mention of digital technologies and copyright law can induce 
a certain mental stupor among many people. The topic is rife with many complicated 
legal and technical issues. But I believe that we commoners have too much at 
stake to leave copyright law to the lawyers and the Internet to the techies. 

The very mission and identity of academia is implicated in the future of digital 
technologies, the Internet and copyright law. At stake is the ability of colleges 
and universities to act as inter-generational stewards of knowledge; to assure 
that their own scholarly output is freely accessible and usable; to curate 
knowledge in better ways and to disseminate it as broadly as possible; and 
to foster innovative research and learning.

The growing sophistication of the digital commons can be seen in its expanding 
political ambitions, collaboratvie innovations and stylish new forms of advocacy. 
Below, three examples of highly original commons-based projects that really rock. 

[Critical Commons][3] is a new nonprofit advocacy coalition for “fair and critical 
participation in media culture.” Its self-stated goal is “to build open, informed 
communities around media-based teaching, learning and creativity, both inside 
and outside of formal educational environments.” The “tag cloud” for the site 
suggests the lit-crit predilections of the site’s hosts. Among the key words 
are “Deleuze,” “narrative structure,” “transverberation,” “ideological analysis,” 
“gender,” “VR “ [virtual reality”] and “TV.” [Deleuze was an influential French philosopher.] 

October 19 to 23, marked the first international Open Access Week, a time for 
university campuses to learn about the various ways of accessing and sharing 
academic research more freely.

On more than 100 campuses, students and faculty heard talks about copyright 
issues for instructors, open access journal publishing, graduate student publishing, 
finding copyright-free images, and using open educational resources in the classroom. 

Last year, 120 campuses in 27 countries marked Open Access Day, which was apparently 
so successful that organizers decided to turn the event into a week-long teach-in 
and celebration.
