Raj Patel has been tracking the pathologies of the global food system for many 
years.  An activist and academic who teaches at the UC Berkeley Center for 
African Studies, Patel has just published a second, updated edition of his 
2008 book, [_Stuffed and Starved_: _ The Hidden Battle for the World Food System_][1].  

The problem with the food system is not that we don't produce enough calories 
to eradicate hunger, Patel notes.  It's that the food system has its own priorities 
of institutional consolidation and profit, which means that more than 1 billion 
people in the world are malnourished and 2 billion are overweight – which is 
worse than when the first edition of Patel's book came out. 

Patel has also been a serious student of the commons.  His 2010 book, [_The 
Value of Nothing:  How to Reshape the Market Society and Redefine Democracy, 
_][2]is a lucid overview of the fallaciious premises of market economics and 
its dismal performance.  He also goes on at length about the ability of the 
commons paradigm to help ameliorate food sovereignty, environmental sustainability 
and social justice.![][3]

Recommended reading is [a recent interview with Patel at _Stir_,][4] the vigorous, 
commons-oriented British political journal founded by Jonathan Gordon-Farleigh.  
(Incidentally, Stir is in the midst of [a Kickstarter campaign][5] to pay for 
a print run of a book collecting some of its best articles.)

Here are a few excerpts from _Stir_’s interview with Patel:   

_On genetically modified crops & climate change:  _“We have an increasing amount 
of evidence to suggest that agro-ecological farming systems will be able to 
feed the world in the future.  The GM advocates are saying, “What about drought-resistance 
and climate-change-ready crops?” That seems to be nonsense!  To have a crop 
that is climate-change-ready is ludicrous because change is precisely change 
— it is so many different things.  It could be new pests, rains coming at the 
wrong time; it could be too much rain, or too much heat.  It is impossible 
to have a single crop that is ready for those possible changes.  We’ve already 
seen the limits of that because Monsanto has a product called ‘Drought Guard’ 
— a genetically-modified crop that performs no better than any conventional 
crop in resisting anything but a mild drought.  The problem with this is that 
climate change isn’t about mild anything but extreme weather events.”

A thousand-year-old tradition of farming commons in southern England may be 
jeopardized as housing prices drive out farmers and render the commoning rights 
moot.  Yes, there are still self-identified commoners in England.  [BBC radio 
recently interviewed ][6]a handful of the remaining commoners who rely upon 
the New Forest in Hampshire to feed their cattle, sheep and chickens.  [The 
23-minute radio report ][7]focused on how the farming commons is a way of life 
that has preserved the distinctive ecological landscape – and how this future 
is now in doubt.

New Forest is said to be the largest remaining tracts of unenclosed pasture 
land, healthland and forest in the southeast portion of England.  The land 
became a royal forest in 1079 when King William I shut down 20 hamlets and 
isolated farmsteads, provoking an uproar.  He then consolidated the land into 
a single tract, the New Forest, which he used for royal hunts. ![][8]

The traditions of commoning in the New Forest are quite involved and detailed, 
as Wikipedia notes:

> 
> Commons rights are attached to particular plots of land (or in the case of 
> turbary, to particular heaths), and different land has different rights – and 
> some of this land is some distance from the Forest itself.  Rights to graze 
> ponies and cattle are not for a fixed number of animals, as is often the case 
> on other commons. Instead a _marking fee_ is paid for each animal each year 
> by the owner. The marked animal's tail is trimmed by the local _agister_ (Verderers’ 
> official), with each of the four or five Forest a_gisters _using a different 
> trimming pattern. Ponies are branded with the owner's brand mark; cattle may 
> be branded, or nowadays may have the brand mark on an ear tag.

Rarely have I read an essay that knits together some very different commons 
with such wisdom and depth. Joline Blais' 2006 essay, [“Indigenous Domain: 
Pilgrims, Permaculture and Perl,”][9] is a wonderfully insightful analysis 
that reveals the underlying unity and logic of commons principles. Her piece 
appeared in [_Intelligent Agent_][10] (vol. 6, no. 2), published by the Inter-Society 
for the Electronic Arts.

Blais' essay is valuable because it speaks to the rift that is said to separate 
commons based on natural resources and those of cyberspace. The segregation 
of those two classes of commons has always bothered me. There are of course 
significant differences between managing depletable natural resources and managing 
cheap and limitless stores of digital information. Yet it has always struck 
me that the two great tribes of commoners have much more in common than not, 
and should be in closer consultation with each other.

Blais not only confirms this, she suggests a way forward. She does this by 
applying her extensive knowledge of actual indigenous peoples to contemporary 
permaculture and digital culture. The links that she draws among them are not 
rhetorical or metaphorical, but explanatory. Because she understands the common 
paradigm is about integrating resources, social relationships and culture into 
a single system, she is able to identify recurrent patterns of commoning in 
some very different resource regimes.

For example, Blais draws clear connections between Native Americans managing 
their lands and the permaculture movement.  The latter, emulating indigenous 
peoples, is trying to re-create sustainable human/nature relationships in a 
modern context. She also shows how the cultural practices of indigenous peoples 
resemble those of digital communities. One example is the community of programmers 
that created and maintains Perl, a programming language, in its low-tech, high-trust 
systems of self-governance.

The women of Erakulapally – a small village two hours west of Hyderabad, India 
– spread a blanket onto the dusty ground and carefully made thirty piles of 
different seeds:  their treasure, the symbols of their emancipation.  A rich 
aroma wafts through the air. 

For these women – all of them _dalit_, members of the poorest and lowest social 
caste in India – seeds are not just seeds.  They are the vehicle for a remarkable 
transformation in their lives, local farming and thei![][11]r ecosystem. 

Over the past twenty-five years, thousands of women in small villages in the 
Andhra Pradesh region of India have escaped from working as low-paid, bonded 
laborers, to become self-reliant farmers able to grow enough to feed their 
households.  Food was once unaffordable and hunger common.  Now the women can 
feed their families, often without having to buy anything in the market.  Despite 
their status as _dalits_, they are no longer filled with fear and anxiety, 
but rather show great confidence and pride in themselves.

A group of us attending the recent conference of the International Association 
for the Study of the Commons drove out to meet the women last week.  We were 
welcomed with a tasty millet-based drink and a short chorus of joyous singing.  
Our meeting was hosted by the Deccan Development Society (DDS), a grassroots 
organization that is helping the poorest rural women of India recover their 
rich traditions of sharing seeds and community-managed farming.  The foyer 
of the building in which we met featured a “seed shrine” -- dozens of small 
clay pots filled to the brim with colorful seeds.

Every two years, the universe of scholars who study the commons converge on 
some spot on the planet to present their research findings, argue about theoretical 
models and party-hardy.  Just kidding about that last one, but it is hard to 
imagine a more interesting party than 600 people from 90 countries around the 
world. 

I have encountered an Indian economist who has closely studied the role of 
women in improving the sustainability of forest commons in Nepal (Bina Agarwal), 
an Australian academic who has written about modern-day gleaning such as “dumpster 
diving” (James Arvanitakis), a British activist who helped pass a modern-day 
law to protect British common lands (Kate Ashbrook of the Open Spaces Society), 
an Indian-American who is studying how language shapes our ability to understand 
the commons (Vijaya Nagarajan), a Belgian historian of the European commons 
(Tine De Moor), among many others.

![][12]

It is quite a pleasant shock to suddenly be around so many people who not only 
know what the commons is; they can get into some rather arcane and sophisticated 
arguments about it.  The conference is skewed towards academics, however, which 
means that the policy and activist sensibility is somewhat muted.  That’s too 
bad, but I hope it might change in the future. 

There is also an emphatic focus on natural resource commons, with a very limited 
exploration of so-called “new commons,” by which the IASC academics mean commons 
that have arisen in unconventional realms such as the Internet.  I find this 
too bad, because there is so much to be learned from digital commons, which 
are among the most robust commons out there.  The phrase “new commons” is also 
vaguely off-putting because it privileges the natural resource commons so absolutely.  
Now I have an inkling of how Native Americans must have felt to have been “discovered.” 

The Pavlovsk Experimental Station near St. Petersburg, Russia, is considered 
a priceless repository of agricultural biodiversity. An estimated 90 percent 
of its seed varieties are not found anywhere else on the planet — more than 
5,000 rare varieties of fruits and berries from dozens of countries. The seeds 
are irreplaceable jewels of genetic history that could be vital in developing 
new plant varieties as climate change threatens existing varieties of plants. 

But soon, if a Russian court ruling is allowed to stand, the land now occupied 
by the seed bank could be turned into -- a privately owned housing development. 
The seeds could be destroyed, and the consequences for the world's agricultural 
diversity could be devastating.

According to Food Democracy Now:

Could Professor Elinor Ostrom’s Nobel Prize for Economics betoken a shift in 
development policies used in Africa? Korir Sing’Oei, an international human 
rights lawyer with a focus on indigenous and minority rights law and policy, 
believes Ostrom’s Nobel could have a significant impact on Africa’s poor.

Sing’Oei is co-founder of CEMIRIDE, the Centre for Minority Rights Development 
in Kenya. Writing in the Pambazuka News, a pan-African website, Sing’Oei points 
out that Garrett Hardin’s "tragedy of the commons" parable was responsible 
for spurring the privatization of land rights over the past generation. Development 
authorities favored access and use of agricultural lands under market-based 
policies. Sing’Oei writes:

A century ago, in 1905, there were more than 6,500 distinct varieties of apples 
to eat, [reports Verlyn Klinkenborg in the New York Times.][13] People had 
their own favorite apples when it came to cooking and eating. They would use 
different ones for making pies, cider and apple sauce. They could choose from 
an exotic array of apples with names like Scollop Gillyflower, Red Winter Pearmain, 
Kansas Keeper.

Now, Klinkenborg writes, "only 11 varieties make up 90 percent of all the apples 
sold in this country, and Red Delicious alone counts for nearly half of that." 
For those who wonder what an enclosure of the commons looks like, this is a 
prime example.
