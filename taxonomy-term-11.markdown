The tech world frequently talks about open source software as a collaborative 
endeavor, but it is less apt to use the word “commons,” let alone engage in 
rigorous empirical analysis for understanding how software commons actually 
work.  The arrival _of Internet Success:  A Study of Open-Source Software Commons_ 
(MIT Press) is therefore a welcome event.  This book is the first large-scale 
empirical study to look at the social, technical and institutional aspects 
of free, libre and open source software (often known as “FLOSS”).  It uses 
extensive firsthand survey research, statistical analysis and commons frameworks 
for studying this under-theorized realm.

While most people may associate open source software with Linux, there are 
in fact tens of thousands of open source projects in existence.  Many consist 
of no more than two or three participants, and may have only an irregular existence.  
However, many thousands of others attract a small but spirited team, and still 
others are huge, robust social ecosystems in their own right.

The authors of _Internet Success_, UMass Professor Charles M. Schweik and consultant 
Robert C. English, looked at the large universe of FLOSS projects hosted on 
SourceForge.net, a website that functions as a kind of clearinghouse for over 
260,000 FLOSS projects (as of February 2011) and 2.7 registered software developers.  
The site provides most of the tools that developers need to find colleagues 
and build a new FLOSS program – a Web repository of code, bug-tracking utilities, 
online forums, email mailing lists, a wiki, file downloading services, etc.  

While SourceForge is not the only such site for FLOSS projects, it is the largest 
and arguably representative of the universe of such projects.  With support 
from the National Science Foundation, Schweik and English set out to study 
the pool of software development projects on SourceForge to try to determine 
why some succeed, why others fail and why others simply languish.  They explain 
in excruciating technical, social science detail how they assembled and analyzed 
their datasets, which originate in a vast collection of SourceForge data on 
more than 130,000 projects as well as their own survey questionnaire of programmers. 
 

Most Facebook users have become so accustomed to working on the “corporate 
plantation” as "digital sharecroppers" that they lose any interest in controlling 
their own digital lives and content.  It is a welcome development, therefore, 
to see enterprising souls like Owen Mundy develop a free app that lets people 
reclaim their data from their Facebook accounts.

[Give Me My Data, ][2] which is officially in “public-beta” release, is an 
attempt to give social network users control over their own stuff.  You might 
want to delete your account but retain your accumulated postings, for example.  
Or you might want to get around the Facebook interface, archive your content 
or perhaps make artwork from it.  The content can be exported into a variety 
of common formats.

Give Me My Data is not only a useful free software tool (licensed under a Creative 
Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike license), it’s a way of sending 
a signal to the corporate goliath Facebook that users have some choices and 
just might decide to go elsewhere.   Mundy sees his app as a vehicle for public 
education:  “While clearly utilitarian,” he writes, “this project intervenes 
into online user experiences, provoking users to take a critical look at their 
interactions within social networking websites. It suggests data is tangible 
and challenges users to think about ways in which their information is used 
for purposes outside of their control by government or corporate entities." 

_I delivered the following remarks on May 11 as part of The Illahee Lecture 
Series 2011, "Searching for Solutions:  Innovation for the Public Good," in 
Portland, Oregon._

This evening, I’d like to get innovative about how we think about innovation 
itself.  The corporate cliché is to “think outside the box.”  That is such 
an _inside-the-box_ way of thinking!  I say let’s get rid of the box!  Tonight 
I want to talk about a new vector of innovation:  how we’re going to manage 
our dwindling, finite natural resources and arrest the pathological growth 
imperatives of our economy while recovering a more sane, socially constructive 
way of life for human beings.  Now _there’s_ a radical innovation challenge! 

The subtext of most innovation-talk these days is efficiency and profitability.  
Innovation is essentially the bigger-better-faster ethic – the next super-computer 
or bio-engineered cow or Segue scooter.  But the grim reality is that there 
are a whole class of societal problems that are not likely to become market 
opportunities,_ever_. 

Worse, conventional markets, in the course of creating new wealth, are generating 
all sorts of _illth_, in John Ruskin’s phrase – cost, unintended byproducts 
that must be put on the ledger sheet in any calculation of our supposed wealth.  
Our market economy is generating whole new classes of illth such as  global 
warming, dying coral reefs, biodiversity loss and species extinctions. 

The City of Linz in Austria has long been in the forefront of civic-minded 
uses of the Internet and digital technologies.  In 1979, it started the Ars 
Electronica festival, a showcase for cutting-edge experiments in digital and 
media arts, which was followed in 1987 with the Prix Ars Electronica, a prestigious 
international award for the most exemplary, pioneering websites and computer 
art.  In 2005 the city built 118 wifi hotspots in public squares so that citizens 
could have free access to the Internet.  Through the [Public Space Server project][3], 
Linz began to provide personal e-mail inboxs on the city’s servers and to host 
non-commercial content on the Internet.

So it is exciting to learn that the City of Linz is now trying to take the 
free culture/open platform sensibility to a whole new level.  It wants to use 
the Internet to transform city politics, governance and culture into a vast 
ecosystem of commons.  Last July city officials announced that it would launch 
[Open Commons Region Linz][4], a series of region-wide initiatives that aspires 
to make local information and creativity as open, accessible and shareable 
as possible.  The Green Party and politically minded digital leaders believe 
that by making it easy for citizens to access and share knowledge on a local 
basis, it will stimulate digital innovators to produce locally useful information 
tools while encouraging greater civic engagement and more robust economic development. 

One of the recurrent questions that people have about the future of the Internet 
is, _So how are creators going to make money in the digital environment?_  
The good news is that the Free Culture Forum – a Barcelona-based international 
gathering of free software, free culture, creators and policy activists – has 
addressed these very questions in a major “how to” guide that was just released.    

In “Sustainable Models for Creativity in the Digital Age,” the FCF affirms:  

We can no longer put off re-thinking the economic structures that have been 
producing, financing and funding culture up until now.  Many of the old models 
have become anachronistic and detrimental to civil society.  The aim of this 
document is to promote innovative strategies to defend and extend the sphere 
in which human creativity and knowledge can prosper freely and sustainably. 

This report is aimed at policy reformers, citizens and free/libre culture activists 
to provide them practical tools to understand the policy options and revenue 
models, and the importance of the commons in the new digital marketplaces. 

The U.S. Government’s ongoing crusade against WikiLeaks and the Egyptian Government’s 
shutdown of the Internet for five days force us to ask the question:  How shall 
the commoners retain their right to communicate with each other when their 
own governments intervene to stifle communications that threaten their power? 

Eben Moglen, a long-time free software advocate, is promoting a great insurance 
policy:  decentralized, portable, personal servers.  He calls them [“Freedom 
Boxes.” ][5] The idea is that everyone should have a small, cheap personal 
server about the size of a cellphone charger.  Such devices alre![][6]ady exist, 
he points out in [today’s NYT][7], and cost about $99, and will likely become 
cheaper in coming months and years.  (A speech that Moglen gave on this topic, 
“Freedom in the Cloud,” on February 5, 2010, can be seen on YouTube [here.][8]  
)

What’s missing at the moment is the software to make them easy to use.  So 
Moglen is calling upon the software programmers of the world to develop free 
software that could make the Freedom Box a viable, pervasive part of the Internet 
infrastructure.  We would no longer have to depend upon the good graces of 
a Google, Facebook or Internet service provider to reliably connect us or transact 
business for us.  We would have assured communications and commercial relationships 
without the threat of government interference or snooping, often through underhanded 
means.

Two weeks ago,[ I blogged about how Brazil is turning its back on the free 
software and free culture movements][9], and moving to defend entrenched, proprietary 
cultural industries:  a terribly disappointing turn of events.  Now there is 
an international petition being circulated in Portuguese, French, Spanish and 
English to express widespread dismay at this recent turn of events. A copy 
of the petition is below.  You can sign it by going to [this website.][10] 

The petition follows:

Presidente Dilma Roussef e à Ministra da Cultura Ana Buarque de Hollanda][11])_ 

 

**Academia as a Commons:**

**The Promise of Digital Technologies ****at Amherst College and the Five Colleges** 

_The following remarks were made by David Bollier, Croxton Lecturer at the 
Robert Frost Library, Amherst College, on April 26, 2010._

I am particularly pleased to be delivering these remarks in Frost Library, 
ground zero for my intellectual wanderlust as an Amherst student, class of 
1978.  Libraries are also a deep part of my family tradition.  My father was 
for many years a librarian at Yale Divinity School Library, and so it pleases 
me to be able to do my part to support my local library. 

Allow me to make a quick introduction of myself so you can get a sense of my 
mission in life.  I am not an academic, although I am currently pretending 
to be one as the Croxton Lecturer here at Amherst College.  I’m teaching Sociology 
42, a seminar called “The Rise of the Commons,” which draws upon my extensive 
writing and thinking about the commons.            

As commercial interests try to convert what has essentially been a commons 
into a total market order, the Internet is experiencing a mid-life crisis.  
The open Internet is in the process of being enclosed by a variety of commercial 
forces.  The struggle for political and creative freedom is getting more urgent 
and complicated as commercial forces try to “develop” the Internet.

The challenge for people who believe in free culture is to reinterpret the 
core values of the Internet and somehow develop new ways to protect them in 
today’s more complicated environment.

**FLOSS as Commons**:  What is the way, what are the actions for having FLOSS 
acknowledged globally as a strategic and crucial common for knowledge society?  
Is FLOSS paving the way for bigger initiatives and larger variety of commons?
