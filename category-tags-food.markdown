Raj Patel has been tracking the pathologies of the global food system for many 
years.  An activist and academic who teaches at the UC Berkeley Center for 
African Studies, Patel has just published a second, updated edition of his 
2008 book, [_Stuffed and Starved_: _ The Hidden Battle for the World Food System_][1].  

The problem with the food system is not that we don't produce enough calories 
to eradicate hunger, Patel notes.  It's that the food system has its own priorities 
of institutional consolidation and profit, which means that more than 1 billion 
people in the world are malnourished and 2 billion are overweight – which is 
worse than when the first edition of Patel's book came out. 

Patel has also been a serious student of the commons.  His 2010 book, [_The 
Value of Nothing:  How to Reshape the Market Society and Redefine Democracy, 
_][2]is a lucid overview of the fallaciious premises of market economics and 
its dismal performance.  He also goes on at length about the ability of the 
commons paradigm to help ameliorate food sovereignty, environmental sustainability 
and social justice.![][3]

Recommended reading is [a recent interview with Patel at _Stir_,][4] the vigorous, 
commons-oriented British political journal founded by Jonathan Gordon-Farleigh.  
(Incidentally, Stir is in the midst of [a Kickstarter campaign][5] to pay for 
a print run of a book collecting some of its best articles.)

Here are a few excerpts from _Stir_’s interview with Patel:   

_On genetically modified crops & climate change:  _“We have an increasing amount 
of evidence to suggest that agro-ecological farming systems will be able to 
feed the world in the future.  The GM advocates are saying, “What about drought-resistance 
and climate-change-ready crops?” That seems to be nonsense!  To have a crop 
that is climate-change-ready is ludicrous because change is precisely change 
— it is so many different things.  It could be new pests, rains coming at the 
wrong time; it could be too much rain, or too much heat.  It is impossible 
to have a single crop that is ready for those possible changes.  We’ve already 
seen the limits of that because Monsanto has a product called ‘Drought Guard’ 
— a genetically-modified crop that performs no better than any conventional 
crop in resisting anything but a mild drought.  The problem with this is that 
climate change isn’t about mild anything but extreme weather events.”

Every day all sorts of fascinating, commons-relevant stories flow through my 
computer. I thought I'd showcase a few of the more notable ones. 

**Silent Protocol Wars**

_Radical Philosophy_, a UK journal, has a fascinating essay, [“A Tale of Two 
Worlds,” ][6] by Nicolás Mendoza, about the “silent protocol wars” that websites 
like WikiLeaks, 4Chan and the Anonymous hackers are embroiled in with nation-states. 
The “de-localized collaborative community” is arguably the biggest social innovation 
of the Internet. It is the source of what Mendoza calls a “rogue episteme” 
– alternative, sometimes-subversive ways of seeing and engaging with the world. 
But will these alternative networked communities be made technically impossible 
if they continue to challenge the authority and control of the nation-state? 
Recent provocations by WikiLeaks (the US Embassy Cables leak) and Anonymous' 
retaliatory acts raise the question.  The implications for the civic sovereignty 
of citizens elsewhere around the world is huge.

Mendoza writes: 

“There is no remote corner of the Internet not dependent on protocols,” Laura DeNardis insists. What DeNardis stresses is the ultimate preponderance of the technical over the social protocol. Lessig inaugurated this line of thinking when he famously stated “Code is Law.” But protocol runs deeper than software: if code is law then protocol is the 
constitution. This is why, as long as attention is diverted toward anything 
spectacular (like tactical and superficial DdoS [denial of service] attacks), 
governments can start the demolition of the protocols that grant the possibility 
of autonomy to the network. In reaction to the release of the US Embassy Cables 
[by WikiLeaks], the UN called for the creation of a group that would end the 
current multi-stakeholder nature of the Internet Governance Forum (IGF) to 
give the last word on Internet control to the governments of the world. 

Governments, of course, want to assure their own capacity to conduct surveillance, 
censorship and control. The question is whether the autonomous communities 
as embodied by WikiLeaks and Anonymous (who act as a vanguard for the larger, 
less politicized set of Internet users) can survive the protocol wars. “This 
is where the war stands to be won,” writes Mendoza: “in the building of autonomous 
structures of all sorts (structures that bypass and outcompete existing ones) 
on top of other new structures until the entire old world is unnecessary.” 

A new British publication, _Stir_, short for Stir to Action, has released its 
second issue as editor Jonathan Gordon-Farleigh bravely tries to give voice 
to a new kind of post-liberal, globally aware activist readership.  True to 
its name, _Stir_ features a number of provocative articles and invigorating 
interviews with iconoclasts.  If we're lucky, this venture from the edge may 
actually help assemble a "constituency of unrealistic pragmatists," in the 
words of George McKay, author of a wonderful piece on on [“radical gardening.”][7] 

In an[ interview with author Mckenzie Wark][8], we learn some of the lessons 
that the Situationists may have for contemporary political and cultural activism.  
The Situationist International “was an extremely marginal avant-garde movement 
that was formed in 1957 and then dissolved itself in 1972,” Wark noted, describing 
his new book, _The Beach Beneath the Street_.  “Why the hell would anybody 
be interested in this tiny marginal activity? The footprint the Situationists 
left in political aesthetic culture is vastly greater than their actual numbers. 
As their leading light, Guy Debord, said ‘all you need is a few trustworthy 
comrades’.”

That’s a great premise for any movement:  a few trustworthy comrades with the 
imagination and daring to challenge the narcoleptic conformism of our times.  
Even some of the most active activists that I know are half-asleep because 
they have so internalized the prevailing political paradigm and cultural norms. 
 

Imagine that you're a company that is increasingly besieged by complaints that 
your heavily advertised junk foods and sugary drinks are contributing to obesity, 
diabetes and other health problems. The First Lady has even gotten into the 
act, making "eating healthy" a personal priority. Naturally, the company wants 
to neutralize public criticisms about its unhealthy products and refurbish 
its corporate image.

What better way than to buy a slice of respectability and high-minded objectivity 
from an Ivy League school -- say, Yale University?

That’s exactly what PepsiCo did recently when it announced that it would fund 
a graduate fellowship in nutritional science at the Yale School of Medicine. 
The masters or PhD student will explore "obesity, diabetes and metabolic syndrome." 
The depressing part is, Yale was only too eager to play along and sell its 
name for peanuts. It will receive $250,000 over the course of five years. For 
this, the dean of Yale School of Medicine, Robert Alpern, praised "PepsiCo's 
commitment to improving health through proper nutrition" and called PepsiCo's 
partnership with Yale "a visionary investment in the future of science."

What happens when a market-based agricultural juggernaut invades a 9,000-year-old 
system of commons-based maize production in Mexico? What are the on-the-ground 
consequences? How have the farmers using traditional agriculture responded? 
Journalist Peter Canby offers a stunning account of this saga in his well-reported 
piece in The Nation, [“Retreat to Subsistence.”][9] Highly recommended reading. 

After seeing a famous painting by Francois Milet, _Les Graneuses_ ("The Gleaners"), 
of a group of women stooped over picking up leftover stalks of wheat, French 
documentary film maker Agnes Varda began to wonder about modern-day gleaners 
— the people who scavenge their food from the scraps that our modern industrial 
society discards as waste. She wondered about trash in our modern times: “Who 
finds a use for it? How? Can one live on the leftovers of others?"

The result, _The Gleaners and I_, is a moving depiction of the people who — 
after the harvest — pick through the dirt to find potatoes and tomatoes left 
behind, scour the beach for oysters washed up after storms, pick grapes and 
figs that farmers reject, and go "dumpster diving" to recover discarded loaves 
of bread, sandwiches and other food.

A century ago, in 1905, there were more than 6,500 distinct varieties of apples 
to eat, [reports Verlyn Klinkenborg in the New York Times.][10] People had 
their own favorite apples when it came to cooking and eating. They would use 
different ones for making pies, cider and apple sauce. They could choose from 
an exotic array of apples with names like Scollop Gillyflower, Red Winter Pearmain, 
Kansas Keeper.

Now, Klinkenborg writes, "only 11 varieties make up 90 percent of all the apples 
sold in this country, and Red Delicious alone counts for nearly half of that." 
For those who wonder what an enclosure of the commons looks like, this is a 
prime example.
